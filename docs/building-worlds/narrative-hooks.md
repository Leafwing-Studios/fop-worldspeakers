# Narrative Hooks: Signposts, not Roads

Building an entire world from scratch that’s full of exciting places is time-consuming and difficult. Building one with those qualities which is also flexible to changes in the desires of your table is nearly impossible. 

To solve these problems, we provide a different approach. *Make signposts, not roads.* Don’t build out a full world (or all the things in it), build out a few **narrative hooks** that the party can explore and interact with as they desire. Keep these ideas very general: **you need only a sentence or two for the basic idea.**

In the next sections (and chapters) we talk about how to fill out the details of these hooks, but **you shouldn’t start writing exact details until you need to.** This is more time-efficient, and helps you stay flexible to changes in both your own thought process and the table’s desired themes and ideas. Don’t waste your time building out a whole area, only to find out that the party doesn’t care about it. 

Some examples of good narrative hooks:
- Legends say that somewhere out there, there’s a waterfall that falls up.
- A local mage has put up a flier asking for help with an experiment, hinting at exciting developments in teleportation technology.
- A news report comes in of a derelict bunker by a group called Johansson Robotics. The bunker appears to be abandoned, but there is some rumor that the group is still active.
- Some townsfolk talk of strange dreams where they are asked to create an odd structure. Several suspect a nearby font is the source of these desires.
