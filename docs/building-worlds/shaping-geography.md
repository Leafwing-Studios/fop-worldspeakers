# Shaping Geography: Zooming In

When it comes time to build out a hook, the important places are built by **zooming in.** As with the narrative hooks, you need not zoom in further than is necessary. Create the places that the party expressed interest in, and expand it further as it is needed. 

This expansion can happen either in session planning, or while playing. Generally, larger places are fleshed out when planning for a session. You may fill out sheets about fonts, or make a short document with information about a city. Smaller places are usually improvised during play. You may come up with a description of a dignitary’s house when you come to that scene in your module. 

Typically, the entry point for this zooming and expansion process will be the font of power in that area. It’s extremely rare for an adventure or module to be not near a font, and the concept is flexible enough to encompass virtually any kind of dangerous or interesting place. 

In general, **fonts** contain **towns** and **dungeons** at their top level, which in turn contain **people, encounters,** and **treasures.** With encounters finally containing **monsters.** Future chapters will discuss building these elements in more details.
