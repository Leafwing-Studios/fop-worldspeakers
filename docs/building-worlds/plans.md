# Plans: Made to be Broken

When structuring sequences of events, remember that **you don’t have plans, the NPCs in your world have plans.** This is a subtle but important difference because players can and should directly interfere with the plans of your NPCs, and those people have limited tools and methods to stop that interference.

The [clock to midnight](toolbox/clock-to-midnight.md) is an invaluable tool here to figure out what the *default* actions of your person or group of people should be. And those are just default actions. The exciting storytelling comes when the players start to interfere. When that happens, answer the following question: **How would this person or group respond now that they’ve been thrown off course?**

If, for whatever reason, it is essential that a certain series of events occur in the narrative, **make a font of power responsible for that particular plan.** This personifies the font, and helps make sure that the plan goes off (relatively) smoothly.  Players are much weaker than an entire font of power, and so their meddling will only change the details, not the broad strokes.
