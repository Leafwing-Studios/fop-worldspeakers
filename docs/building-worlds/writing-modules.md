# Writing Modules: Just in Time

As with the sections that precede this one, you should only build what you need to. While geography zooms in as needed, **modules** and **events** are created **just in time.** In Fonts of Power, the players have considerable agency in which direction the story goes, so it’s not possible to plan many sessions in advance. **You can only look ahead one session in the future.**

Rather than expecting people to perfectly guess each other’s intentions, we encourage **worldspeakers and players to communicate their plans** back and forth. The best way to do this is to **end your sessions at the conclusions of story arcs,** and then **ask your players what they want to do next** during the session recap as you determine the amount of experience that the party earned. If the party is having trouble deciding, give them a small list of narrative hooks to choose from, and ask them to pick one.

**Dealing with cliffhangers and larger arcs**

The advice to end sessions at the conclusion of small story arcs may seem concerning due to its limitation. While cliffhangers are certainly possible, Fonts of Power tends to naturally reach stopping points when the party rests for downtime. 

Secondly, this “just in time” approach does **not** mean that you cannot have larger, overarching stories, simply that they are handled differently. Methods for doing this are discussed in [Keeping Larger Plans.](/)

In general, modules are constructed by creating a series of **scenes,** and optionally a **dungeon.** Not every scene or dungeon in a module will be explored, and the order may vary from table to table. Scenes and dungeons will be talked about more in later chapters.
