# Building Worlds

While we have many wonderful **modules** available for tables to play, many worldspeakers take great joy and satisfaction in creating their own worlds and stories. This section gives an overview for the strategies used in this process. As explained in this chapter, when making worlds and stories for the tabletop, **you should only create as much as you need to.**
- Creating **narrative hooks** that you and your players can explore as desired
- **Zooming into** places of interest as they are looked at more closely
- Building **modules** of adventure and story based on the partyâ€™s plans
- Developing **plans** of your own with the expectation that they will go wrong
- **Recycling** content that goes unused, to avoid repeating work unnecessarily

**What this chapter is not**

This chapter will **not** be discussing the art of worldbuilding as it exists across genres. Much existing literature has already been written about how to create rich, fantasy worlds for novels and films. The tactics for those mediums translate quite cleanly to the tabletop, so we will not repeat them here. We encourage worldspeakers to seek out these resources as they have time and interest. Instead, this chapter will focus on the differences in building worlds on the tabletop, and how to efficiently use the **amusement park** approach.

Some have called this the **amusement park** approach: scenery in amusement parks only goes as far as it needs to, and other parts of the park are kept out of sight to build immersion.
