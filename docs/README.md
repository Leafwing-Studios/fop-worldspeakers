# Fonts of Power Worldspeaker's Guide

In *Fonts of Power,* the **worldspeaker** is responsible for bringing the world and its inhabitants to life. Analogous to the game master in other systems, we shift some of the agency and burdens back onto the players, making the role more accessible and letting you focus on telling stories. The system’s emphasis on exploration, when combined with the existence of **Resolve** and **downtime activities** tends to result in more proactive parties than you might be used to. Try to focus on setting the stage and then responding to the players’ actions, rather than trying to tightly control an overarching plot.

In this book, we provide the frameworks and raw ingredients you need to tell better stories, create more memorable places and run more dynamic combats. The first half of this book contains concrete, actionable advice on how to run better games:
- The [Worldspeaker’s Toolbox](/) lays out the most fundamental tools for worldspeakers in Fonts of Power: the value of **collaborative rulekeeping,** the power of **questions,** and how to use **tantalizing descriptions** to draw your players into the world.
- The  Building Stories](/) chapter discusses the three defining features of storytelling in TTRPGs. Remember, **you are not alone. You can’t predict the future.** And **you can’t change the past.**
- The [Building Scenarios](/) chapter teaches you to create memorable and believable **NPCs** and **factions,** which tie the player characters to the world they live in. Then, it shows you how to use those bonds to create **situations** that your party will dive into danger to tackle, in a way that doesn’t feel cheap.
- The [Building Worlds](/) chapter presents a collaborative minigame in which you create a world from scratch. By the end of this game, you’ll have the broad history you’ll need to make your world feel real and the raw materials — threats, treasures and clues — that make your dungeons worth exploring.
- The [Building Dungeons](/) chapter contains tangible advice on how to give each dungeon a distinctive character, how to use node-based dungeon design to manage pacing and choice, and then covers the art of environmental storytelling: showing off the history of your dungeon by carefully placing intriguing threats, treasures and clues throughout.
- The [Building Puzzles](/) chapter covers motifs, locks and keys, building cohesion and rewarding ingenuity as they subtly guide your players through the dungeon.
- The [Building Encounters](/) chapter gives you the concrete advice needed to make your fights dynamic, meaningful and challenging.
- The [Building Monsters](/) chapter lays out the exact framework we use for making monsters, discussing how to combine powers and affixes to capture the fantasy of every monster.
- Finally, the [Worldspeaker’s Checklist](/) summarizes the steps laid out in this guide, giving you a single simple list to follow no matter what level of content you’re building.

Learn the rules of the game, read The [Worldspeaker’s Toolbox](/), read [Plan vs Improvise,](/) and then pick up a module: you’re ready to take on your first session as a worldspeaker!
