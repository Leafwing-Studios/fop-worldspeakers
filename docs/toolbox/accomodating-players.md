# Accomodating Players

Some players required special accommodations or strategies to fully enjoy the experience. Perhaps they need information to be shown in a particular format, perhaps they need regular breaks, or maybe they need to move around or fidget with stuff to keep themselves from getting antsy. 

If a player says they need things a certain way, **listen to them.** Most accommodations aren’t too difficult to implement if you’re willing to meet people on their own terms. For example, if a player mentions that it’s hard for them to stay engaged with pure “theater of the mind”, start making little maps for your social scenes so they have something concrete to hold onto. 

An important thing to keep in mind here is to **treat problems, not symptoms** if at all you can. If a player is often on their phone because they’re having trouble focusing, try to figure out why they’re not engaged, changing your approaches if necessary.
