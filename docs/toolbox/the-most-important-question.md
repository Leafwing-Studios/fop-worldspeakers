# The Most Important Question

As we talked about with [Collaborative Rulekeeping](toolbox/collaborative-rulekeeping), it’s important that everyone at the table is included in decisions, so that you all can play the game that’s most interesting and fun for you. As a worldspeaker, you have a particular responsibility to ensure that the world, the people, and the fights are enjoyable for everyone. 

The most important question for you to ask is **How was the session?** After each session’s completion. Explicitly asking for feedback ensures that players feel comfortable bringing up issues with you, and the information is invaluable. This will give you footing to help determine many things:
- Whether the encounters are too difficult or too easy (see [Tuning Difficulty](/))
- Whether the NPCs are compelling
- Whether the party prefers freeform roleplay or gritty dungeon crawling
- If any of your players are uncomfortable with the subject material being explored
