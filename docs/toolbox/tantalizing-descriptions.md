# Tantalizing Descriptions

Inspired by the evocative descriptions in the works of fiction that we love, it’s very tempting to describe scenes, monsters and people in rich, flowing paragraphs of beautiful prose.

Don’t do this. The first reason is very simple: you are likely to mess up. Crafting those descriptions takes much longer than you have, and typically requires several editing passes.

The second reason is more subtle: your players have a limited attention span, and will start to miss details that you intended to be important. This is particularly critical when your descriptions are verbal, rather than written, as they won’t have an artifact to refer back to.

Instead, **stick to one or two sentences, tantalizing your players with brief hints at the elements that you think are important.** Then, pause, and let your players ask questions or take action, expanding on the details as they inquire after them.
