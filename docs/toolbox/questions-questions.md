# Questions, Questions

As the worldspeaker, your most powerful tool is to simply **ask questions.** Draw your players into the world by asking them about their character, and then responding to their actions. Remember that while **you are in charge of the world, your players are in charge of their own characters.** The type of questions you ask depends on their purpose, and the situation at hand.

The most general question that you can ask is **“What do you do?”** This is the easiest and most direct way to signal that the description of the scene is complete, and it’s time for the players to take action. 

When new elements are introduced, **integrate the party into the world** by asking them loaded questions, willingly ceding some of your agency over the fiction of the world:
- Do you recognize this person?
- What does this place remind you of?
- What do you think is going on?

When the party hits a lull, **prompt them to action** by asking focused questions that remind them of their connections to the world and lay out some of the available options:
- Are you going to let them get away with that?
- It looks like there’s a choice to be made: which path do you want to take?
- What about the deal you made?

Follow-up on proposed actions with questions that help you **establish the fiction** that the acting player is aiming for, letting you narrate outcomes and the world’s responses in ways that make sense:
- How do you want to do this?
- What do you want to happen?
- What might go wrong?

When it comes to asking your table questions, try to establish the appropriate level of **narrative agency** for the players in your campaign. Some players want to **create,** adding elements to the plot and their backstories on the fly as they imply facts about the world for you to respond to in both their own questions and their answers.  Other players prefer to **strive,** not wanting to control the story, but instead handle anything and everything it has to throw at them. There’s no right choice, but your table’s stance should dictate how and when you cede narrative agency.
