# One Level Removed

An important thing to keep in mind about playing as the Worldspeaker is that you’re creating narrative **one level removed** from what you may be used to. You aren’t creating stories for people to read, watch, or listen to. You’re **facilitating** the creation of stories for your group of players. 

You’re making the playground to play in, not dictating how people play in it. It’s a level of abstraction that is rarely seen in storytelling, and we talk about this idea much more in [Building Stories](/) and [Building Worlds](/).
