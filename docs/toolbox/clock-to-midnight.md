# Clock to Midnight

Sometimes, the players need a little push to keep the story moving. The clock to midnight is a small piece of framework that defines **what the antagonist of the story will do if the players do nothing.** (This concept is adapted from [Monster of the Week](https://www.evilhat.com/home/monster-of-the-week/).) This is useful for a few things: 
- The **players can’t come up with a plan.** Refer to the clock to midnight to give the players something difficult to deal with. This keeps the story moving.
- The **players prefer to act reactively** instead of proactively. Refer to the clock to midnight. This gives you something for the antagonist to do that the players can react to.
- Use the clock to **raise the stakes.** As time goes on, things get more dire. 
- **Interrupt player plans** that will be seriously problematic. Drop a more urgent problem in their lap to delay their original course of action.

The clock to midnight traditionally has 5 stages, but it can have greater or fewer if desired:
1. Day
1. Shadows
1. Dusk
1. Nightfall
1. Midnight

While the stages are named after points in a single day, the clock can play out over any reasonable time frame. In many cases, it won’t even be a fixed timeframe at all. The traditional method is to pull out events from each stage as they are needed, using them only when it enhances the storytelling. It’s entirely possible that you won’t use any of these, but they’re useful to have as a fallback.

**Example: A Cultist’s Clock to Midnight**

There is a group of cultists hiding in a small town, trying to incite destructive action from the nearby font.
1. Day: The townspeople overhear chanting and strange noises coming from some abandoned buildings.
1. Shadows: A shop in town is broken into. The owner of the shop is mysteriously missing.
1. Dusk: The townspeople begin to get paranoid. People start suspecting their friends of being cult members. Witch trials are starting to take shape in the town square.
1. Nightfall: The cultists take advantage of the situation, successfully convincing the town members to execute someone in the town square. This sacrifice successfully enrages the font.
1. Midnight: The town is obliterated. Some people make it out in time. Some do not.

When designing your own clocks, think about the following questions:
- What does the antagonist do to further their goals?
- Who or what gets hurt? 
- How does society at large feel about what’s happening? How do they respond?
- What is created? What is destroyed?
