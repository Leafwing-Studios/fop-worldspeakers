# Collaborative Rulekeeping

In *Fonts of Power,* **everyone plays within the framework of the rules of the game on the same terms.** Adjudicating rules, and making any changes to them, is the responsibility of the table as a whole, as is the interpersonal burden of resolving conflicts and actually running the game.

If you’ve enjoyed being a game master for other systems before, you might be asking: **why doesn’t Fonts of Power just use a traditional game master?**
- It makes running games **more accessible.**
  - You still need to be willing to roleplay NPCs, fill in details of the world and design encounters for the players to fight and explore.
  - You don’t need to be a master of the rules, unilaterally enforce your authority within the group, or do all the interpersonal work other than actually playing the game.
- It **builds trust** between the worldspeaker and the players, and pushes everyone to play fair just because it’s more fun.
- **Combat runs faster** because everyone is expected to know the common rules of the game and pay attention to what other players are doing to help catch mistakes.
- **Players can make quick, sensible choices** because they have a clear sense of both the stakes and odds.
- Players should have the freedom to **homebrew** too.
  - This system is dramatically easier to create balanced, mechanically meaningful content for than other games you might be used to.
  - The [Hacker’s Guide to Fonts of Power](/) gives you and your players the tools needed to make and evaluate content without worrying about it breaking your game.
- It gives you the freedom to **play harder,** letting you build cohesive monsters and take combat seriously without players worrying about if you’re abusing your power. 
  - You can and should **roll openly:** the combat is designed so you don’t need to worry about having to fudge rolls.
  - Straightforward and playtested **encounter balancing guidelines** let you have a good sense of what you can throw at your party to lead to a genuine struggle.
  - Built-in fail-safes like **escaping combat, nonlethal damage,** rules around **resurrection** and rich **monster motivations** allow fights to end in outcomes other than death, letting you push the envelope without ending a campaign or constantly wasting time making new characters.

Even if you’re still skeptical, we urge you to give it a try, if only for a session or two. In our experience, putting faith in our players has paid off tremendously: they’ve stepped up to learn the rules, play in the spirit of fairness and serve as active participants in the story of the game.

Many of the core systems of the game rely on more player agency than is found in other systems to keep the game running smoothly. If you prefer to take a more traditional role, you should be careful about:
- **Resolve:** remember this system exists and award it generously, to encourage players to take interesting risks and help them recover from mistakes or bad luck.
- **Experience:** this is designed to allow players to advance even when they pursue their own goals. If you change this to better fit the campaign’s vision, changing the amount of experience required per level and the questions asked let you tweak pacing and shift what the party pursues without removing the powerful engagement tool that the existing system provides.
- **Gear:** this is a dominant method of character advancement and player expression. Tightly controlling its supply or the crafting options will lead to difficulties with combat balance, and make it challenging for players to create the characters they want to play.
- **Avoid treadmills:** As players grow in power, they should get tangibly better at things. This is a particularly easy trap to fall into with skill checks if you set their difficulty more freely.
- **Secrets:** Be transparent about the mechanics of the game and its inhabitants. There are many mechanics for players to acquire “metagame” information, such as Clues and the Scan minor action. This helps them make interesting and informed choices and keep play moving, Save secret rolls for when there’s information you have not yet revealed.
- **Puzzles:** Players have more latitude in how exactly they solve puzzles of all kinds than you might be used to. The fail-forward skill mechanics and the existence of the Prepared for Anything system are particularly important. Try to roll with the players’ ideas, but use Scenes liberally to add consequences and interesting mechanics.
