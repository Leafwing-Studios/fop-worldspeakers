# Planning and Improvising

As a worldspeaker, some things (such as high-level worldbuilding, story writing and encounter design) are best planned ahead of time. Other things however are best improvised, letting you respond more quickly to sudden changes and reducing the amount of prep you need to do. 

In future chapters, we will discuss the strategies and frameworks used for planning. In this chapter, we highlight tools for responsive improvisation that work well with this system’s emphasis on player agency.
- You are not alone. You cannot shoulder this alone, but you also don’t have to.
- You can’t predict the future. Nothing ever goes to plan.
- You can’t rewrite the past. Inconsistencies will arise, but we can get around them.

## You are not alone
The table should work together to figure out what stories to tell. **The players have just as much agency in the story writing as you do.** This means that **you don’t have total control** over the events that occur, and players often lead the story in unexpected directions. Turn this into a strength, rather than a challenge. **Lean in** to your players’ ideas, using them to inspire your world as the story unfolds.

Some players will do this without prompting: talking about things in their character’s past, or how a certain town should have a church for their deity. Other players will require prompting. Luckily, this is fairly easy to do: simply **ask players what they think, giving them opportunity to build out the story.** If you see an opportunity for a player to fill out new details, take it.

**Examples: Ceding narrative authority**

* If a player wants to use the Bond downtime activity with a group in town, ask that player to set the scene. 
* If the players need a resource in town, ask if it would be feasible for any of them to know a specialist who works there, then work with the players to flesh out who that character is. 
* If you’re not sure how to resolve a murder plot, as the players for their theories, and pick one that sounds interesting without telling them.

In general, players will start their storytelling with the pieces that they have control over: their characters. However, given encouragement and opportunity, they will slowly start to branch out into other areas, and your job will get progressively easier. **If you give player’s opportunity to fill holes and tell stories, they will rise to it.**

## You can’t predict the future
Between players and dice, **outcomes are always unpredictable.** When preparing for sessions, think about what will happen if the party takes the alternate path, fails the critical skill check, or refuses to cooperate with the helpful NPC. It’s simply not possible to plan for every possible branching path, but try to keep a few likely ones in mind.

The fog of the future lays thick over most events more than one session away. **Have a goal, but be ready to improvise,** and don’t be afraid to move pieces of the adventure around if you need to. Strategies for this are talked about in more detail in [Building Worlds](/). 

**Modules** in Fonts of Power are structured to help with this. They consist of **scenes, not plots,** to make it easier to include or disclude elements as they are relevant, and fill connecting tissue when needed. How these structures are developed and constructed is talked about in more detail in [Building Modules](/). 

In general, you can think of running a module like **navigating a spider web,** with each scene being a connection point between different strands of silk. You move the strands to connection points that the module has planned out. **You may not visit every connection,** but that’s ok. When moving from scene to scene, you can easily improvise the needed connecting tissue, since **you know where you are and where you’re going.** Additionally, the **scenes are quite small,** so if you need to move somewhere that’s unplanned, it’s easy to improvise one, and then connect it once it’s in place.

At the end of each session, **ask your players what their plans are.** This should give you a good sense of what to be ready for, without running into the pitfalls of overplanning. 

## You can’t rewrite the past
In a traditional writing context, the editor can easily go back and change portions of the story before publication. However, in a live game, you do not have this luxury. This makes the requirement to improvise particularly challenging. Players will try things you don’t expect, and you’ll improvise something with unforeseen consequences. Your responses won’t always be perfect, so you need tangible strategies to recover from any plot holes you accidentally create.

The most direct solution to avoid these holes is to **cede narrative authority** and ask for help, as discussed above in [You are not alone](planning-and-improvising?id=you-are-not-alone). This is better for preemptively avoiding holes, rather than patching them.

But sometimes the hole is noticed too late. For example, when setting a scene you say that a cave has twisting, confusing passages with no obvious pattern. A player then points out that, a few sessions ago, you mentioned that this dungeon was made by hewn crystalline- a species known for ordered and regular construction - presenting a contradiction. 

In those situations, consider pulling a **“Let me get back to you on that".** Defer justification until later, giving you time to think of some interesting reason why the strangeness exists. You might literally say “Yes, that is very strange", while quickly making a note to find some explanation. In the next session, you might reveal that the caves were extensively modified by some other group between their construction and current events.

Finally, if all else fails, you can always own up to your mistakes, and ask to **retcon** something from the past. Being honest with your players will earn you a lot of respect, even if it means swallowing some pride. As with all things in Fonts of Power, you will need to come to an agreement with your table on this. Perhaps you all decide that the slight discontinuity isn’t a big enough deal to break immersion, and you all agree to just ignore it. Or perhaps you all agree to go back and change some small details to make the story make sense again. Use this method sparingly: while it is extremely powerful, it’s often slow, and can break the flow of the game.
